Bowtie Round 2 Interview
Mini Project (60 min)

You will be building a simple chat bot for Bowtie Premium Laser Co. that can understand services related laser hair removal!

Please read these instructions carefully and treat this like real world scenario, which means the user input could be anything
# including irrelevant content and misspellings.
#
# I recommend you give yourself 15 min to understand the problem and think of a general strategy, then spend 45 min coding.
#
# ===============
#  Example input
# ===============
#
# User message:
#
#     "Hi, can I get laser hair removal on my arms?"
#
# Bot response format:
#
#     "Sure, which service would you like?
#
#     1. Upper Arms
#     2. Full Arms"
#
# ==========================
#     The bot's response
# ==========================
#
# You can refer to the global variable "services" for a list of all services the bot should understand.
# The global variable "tags" defines alternate phrasing for services that a user might ask for.
#
# For example, if the user says "Can I make a laser appointment?", the bot should match the term "laser" with the corresponding tag, and
# offer all the services in the list given by tags["laser"].
#
# If there are multiple tags present, you should intersect all of the services for those tags and list out the matching services separated by numbered newlines.
# For example if the user says "I want laser hair removal for my arms", the bot should respond: "Sure, which service would you like?\n\n1. Upper Arms\n2. Full Arms".
#
# If a single service is matched, the bot should ask the next question in the booking process and say "Sure! Who would you like to see for your <service>?"
#
# ================
#     The Task
# ================
#
# Please implement the function handle_user_message(user_message) and return the bot's response.
#
# You are provided with two helper functions: is_similar(text, text2) and strip_punctuation(text).
#
# There are 4 test cases defined by the global variable "test_inputs". Keep in mind your code should be general and we will test it on additional test cases.
# We've implemented the main function so if you run this script it will evaluate the 4 test cases.
#
# Here are 2 main things that you should account for:
# 1. Tags with multiple words, ie. "I want a hair removal" should match the "hair removal" tag
# 2. Misspellings in the user input, please use the helper function is_similar()
#
# ===================
#     Final Notes
# ===================
#
# - Feel free to create helper functions and use built-in Python modules, but do not use 3rd party libraries.
# - We will discuss your solution in a follow up.
# - Please don't hardcode responses to pass the tests.
