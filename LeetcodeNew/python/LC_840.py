"""
The intuition is brute force, don't need any tricky.
One thing to pay attention: A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9.
I just find many sumbmission ignoring this condition.

Here I just want share two observatons with this 1-9 condition:

Assume a magic square:
a1,a2,a3
a4,a5,a6
a7,a8,a9

a2 + a5 + a8 = 15
a4 + a5 + a6 = 15
a1 + a5 + a9 = 15
a3 + a5 + a7 = 15

Accumulate all, then we have:
sum(ai) + 3 * a5 = 60
3 * a5 = 15
a5 = 5

The center of magic square must be 5.

Another observation for other 8 numbers:
The even must be in the corner, and the odd must be on the edge.
And it must be in a order like "43816729" ï¼ˆclockwise or anticlockwise)
