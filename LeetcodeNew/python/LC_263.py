"""
Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:

Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2
Example 3:

Input: 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
Note:

1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
Input is within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1].

class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, num: int) -> bool:

        if num <= 0:
            return False

        for x in [2, 3, 5]:
            while num % x == 0:
                num //= x
        return num == 1
