rand7() will get random 1 ~ 7
(rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7() - 1 will get random 0 ~ 48
We discard 40 ~ 48, now we have rand40 equals to random 0 ~ 39.
We just need to return rand40 % 10 + 1 and we get random 1 ~ 7.

In 9/49 cases, we need to start over again.
In 40/49 cases, we call rand7() two times.

Overall, we need 49/40*2 = 2.45 calls of rand7() per rand10().
