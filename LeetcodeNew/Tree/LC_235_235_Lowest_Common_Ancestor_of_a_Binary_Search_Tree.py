Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:
“The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]




Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2,
since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

根据BST的特性，如果p和q里面最大的值都比root.val小的话，那证明p和q都在左边，
所以往左边递归就行，右边递归道理相同。然后第三种case当root.val等于p和q之间一个的时候，
直接返回root即可，因为找到了
