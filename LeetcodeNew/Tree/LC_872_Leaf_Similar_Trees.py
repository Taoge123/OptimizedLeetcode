Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.
From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

"""
General methode is that traverse DFS whole tree to a list and compare two lists.
Here I share an idea of comparing node by node using O(logN) space.

Use a stack<TreeNode> to keep dfs path.
dfs(stack) will return next leaf.
Check leaves one by one, until the end or difference.
Only O(logN) space for stack, no extra space for comparation.
O(1) is also possible if we can modify the tree.
