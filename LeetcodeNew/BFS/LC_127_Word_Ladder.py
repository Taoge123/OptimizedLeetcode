127. Word Ladder
> 类型：BFS
> Time Complexity O(n*26^wordLength)
> Space Complexity O(n)
每次只要对word里面任意字母进行更改以后，就将其放回queue里面。
对于是否访问这个问题，我的写法是写一个visted的set来统计，LC里面有一种直接删除wordList里面访问过的词，想法雷同。
至于记录深度，可以利用python里面tuple的小技巧，每次迭代的时候对tuple里面的计量单位增值即可:
q.append((new_word, length + 1))
最后一点就是开头的arr = set(arr) 用来解决TLE，LC里面有些特别大的重复List很尴尬。
