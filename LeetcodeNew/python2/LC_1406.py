Solution 1: DP
dp[i] means, if we ignore before A[i],
what's the highest score that Alex can win over the Bobï¼Ÿ

There are three option for Alice to choose.
Take A[i], win take - dp[i+1]
Take A[i] + A[i+1], win take - dp[i+2]
Take A[i] + A[i+1] + A[i+2], win take - dp[i+3]
dp[i] equals the best outcome of these three solutions.


Complexity
Time O(N^)
Space O(N)
