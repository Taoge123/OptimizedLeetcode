Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
Note:
You may assume that the array does not change.
There are many calls to sumRange function.

"""
"""
The idea is fairly straightforward: 
create an array accu that stores the accumulated sum for nums 
such that accu[i] = nums[0] + ... + nums[i - 1] in the initializer of NumArray. 
Then just return accu[j + 1] - accu[i] in sumRange. 
You may try the example in the problem statement to convince yourself of this idea.
